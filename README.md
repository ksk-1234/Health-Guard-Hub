This Project is built for managing hospitals rooms and determining the patient's priority for isolation. The app provides a
centralised hub for managing the patients and planning their distribution across hospital’s rooms. It allows nurses to keep track
of the patients and their diseases in real time and to have an overview over the patients and rooms, and better manage the
rooms assignment across patients.
● Future Plan: To stores patients records for easy analysis at the time of diagnosis
